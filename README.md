# SharePoint Content Organizer Link
This solution provides an easy-to-access link to the Drop Off Library.

Why is there no web part to provide the submission to the Drop Off Library?

For document libraries that are targets of Content Organizer rules, the upload link will redirect to the Drop Off Library. Contributors can also navigate directly to the Drop Off library and click upload. But, in the scenario where all the libraries in the site use the Content Organizer, why force the contributor to click into a library? In reality, they could choose any library they want and the document ends up in the correct place. 

So, I finally created a solution: the Content Organizer Link web part.
